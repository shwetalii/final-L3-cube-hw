1)write a simple code to read each line from the log file, tokenise it and display 
the information in tabular format in proper columns.
example:
(IP adress/host id)|(date)|(time)|(+-time zone)|(request type)|(requested resourse)| (http version)
2)store the data from a log file into a database like mysql(relational) or mongodb(non-relational),then we can access that data (i.e. even present it) using sql/mongo db shell commands.
3) we can also draw graphs i.e. bargraph,pie chart,etc to analyse the data like number of requests
recived during different time slots, on different days, also the no of different types of requests,
,etc.
